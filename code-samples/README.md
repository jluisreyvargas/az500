## How to Use These Samples

These code samples are designed to help you understand and practice implementing Azure security concepts. Follow these steps:

1. **Review the code** to understand the security configurations
2. **Test in a sandbox environment** before applying to production
3. **Modify parameters** to match your specific requirements
4. **Reference the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure)** for detailed explanations

## Security Best Practices

When using these code samples, remember to follow security best practices:

- Use managed identities where possible
- Apply the principle of least privilege for access control
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement defense in depth with multiple security layers
- Enable logging and monitoring for security-relevant events
